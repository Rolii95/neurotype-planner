-- This migration has been intentionally disabled.
-- The `run_sql` RPC is a development convenience that allows executing
-- arbitrary SQL via a function. That's unsafe in production so the file
-- has been disabled. If you need a developer-only RPC, create it manually
-- in a non-production environment with strict access controls.

-- Migration disabled on: TODO: replace with date or commit
